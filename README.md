# Brophy UAV — public dashboard

A one-page public site showing the club sim lab's **opening hours**, the **pilot
leaderboard**, the **YouTube playlist** and three **randomly picked videos** from
it. Anyone can open it, any time, from any device. No login, no server.

It is the outward-facing companion to the kiosk in `C:\BrophyUAV` — read that
folder's `CLAUDE.md` first if you are touching either side.

```
C:\BrophyUAV\data\profiles.json  ─┐
C:\BrophyUAV\data\schedule.json   ├─> Publish-Dashboard.ps1 ─> data.json ─> git push
C:\BrophyUAV\config.json          │        (scheduled task,      (this repo)      │
C:\BrophyUAV\index.html          ─┘         every 15 min)                         v
                                                                            Netlify build
                                                                                  │
                                                          index.html fetches data.json
```

**Nothing on this site is live.** It reads one snapshot file. The clock in the
"open now / closed" lamp *is* live, because every opening window in the snapshot
carries an absolute instant, so the page can compare it to the visitor's clock
without knowing anything about Phoenix time.

---

## Finishing the setup

Everything in this folder is built and committed. Three things are left, and all
three need your account, which is why they are not done:

### 1. Create the GitHub repo

Make a **new, empty** repo (no README, no .gitignore — this folder already has
both). Public or private both work; Netlify can build from either.

Then, from a terminal:

```bash
git -C C:\BrophyUAV-web remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USER/brophy-uav-dashboard.git
```

### 2. Push once, by hand

The first push has to be interactive, because it is what signs git in to GitHub.
A browser window opens, you approve, and Git Credential Manager caches the token
in Windows Credential Manager for this user. Every later push is silent.

```bash
git -C C:\BrophyUAV-web push -u origin main
```

### 3. Point Netlify at it

In Netlify: **Add new site → Import an existing project → GitHub →** pick the
repo. Netlify reads `netlify.toml` and needs no other answers:

| | |
|---|---|
| Build command | *(none)* |
| Publish directory | `.` |

Deploy. You get a `something-something.netlify.app` URL; rename it under
**Site configuration → Site details** if you want something you can say out loud.

### 4. Turn on the every-15-minutes publish

```powershell
C:\BrophyUAV\Install-DashboardTask.ps1
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'Brophy UAV Dashboard Publish'
Get-Content C:\BrophyUAV-web\publish.log -Tail 20
```

That is it. From then on the kiosk pushes a fresh snapshot whenever the numbers
change, Netlify rebuilds in a few seconds, and the site is current.

---

## How it updates

`Publish-Dashboard.ps1` runs every 15 minutes and **only commits when the data
actually changed**, ignoring its own timestamp. A room that is shut all weekend
produces zero commits and zero Netlify builds; an afternoon of flying produces
one commit per 15-minute slice that saw activity.

If a push fails — network down, token expired — the commit is already made
locally and the next run carries it. Nothing is lost, and `publish.log` says what
happened.

Run it by hand any time:

```powershell
C:\BrophyUAV\Publish-Dashboard.ps1            # export, commit, push if changed
C:\BrophyUAV\Publish-Dashboard.ps1 -NoPush    # just rewrite data.json
C:\BrophyUAV\Publish-Dashboard.ps1 -Force     # push even if nothing changed
```

---

## What is and is not published

`data.json` is a **derived export**, not a copy of `profiles.json`. It carries:

- display name, total ms, per-sim ms, ground-school percentage and lesson count,
  and a `lastSeen` stamp (used only for the "flying this week" tile)
- the next 28 days of resolved opening windows
- the sim list and the 25 embeddable video ids

It deliberately does **not** carry profile ids, per-lesson timings, scores,
attempt counts, or `created` stamps. If you add a field to the payload, ask
whether it belongs on a URL a stranger can open.

### Changing how names appear

Names are currently published **exactly as typed at the kiosk**, which in
practice is already `First L.` format. To change that, pass `-NameMode`:

| `-NameMode` | `Micah Thompson` becomes |
|---|---|
| `full` *(current)* | `Micah Thompson` |
| `firstlast` | `Micah T.` |
| `initials` | `M.T.` |

To make it permanent, edit the `$NameMode` default at the top of
`C:\BrophyUAV\Publish-Dashboard.ps1`, or add `-NameMode initials` to the task's
action. Then run with `-Force` so the change is published immediately.

---

## Editing the site

`index.html` is the whole site — markup, CSS and JS in one file, no build step,
same as the kiosk. Open it, edit it, commit it.

To preview locally you need real HTTP; `file://` breaks the `fetch` of
`data.json`. Any static server will do.

Design rules carried over from the kiosk, and worth keeping:

- **The grid is the desk; the boxes on it are white.** `--glass` is the field the
  blueprint grid is printed on. `--glass-2` is the opaque white of anything you
  read. Use `background-color:`, never the `background:` shorthand, on desk
  surfaces — the shorthand resets the grid image out from under them.
- **The two pencil faces are for the wordmark only.** Cabin Sketch and Architects
  Daughter appear in the `h1` and the stamp. Nothing read word by word is set in
  them.
- **Nothing smaller than 13px.**
- Fonts come from Google Fonts here, unlike the kiosk, which self-hosts them
  because the school's filtered network made a render-blocking font request stall
  every browser start. A public site has no such constraint.

### The reel

Only the **25 embeddable** videos are in the snapshot. Seven of the 32 in the
playlist have embedding switched off by their owners and answer Error 150 — the
kiosk measured this with `C:\BrophyUAV\concepts\_yt-scan.html`, and a
server-side fetch cannot detect it because YouTube only sends the flag to a real
browser.

The exporter parses the list straight out of the kiosk's `index.html`, so there
is one source of truth. **If the playlist changes, re-run the scanner and update
`var REEL` in `C:\BrophyUAV\index.html`** — the dashboard follows automatically.

Posters are `i.ytimg.com` thumbnails and the player only loads on a tap. If the
thumbnail is blocked, the frame falls back to a drawn panel and the video still
plays.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Where to look |
|---|---|
| Site shows old numbers | `publish.log`. Then `git -C C:\BrophyUAV-web log --oneline -5` — did a commit even happen? |
| `git push failed` in the log | The cached token is gone. Push once by hand to re-authenticate. If it only fails from the task and not by hand, re-run `Install-DashboardTask.ps1 -Interactive`. |
| A PowerShell window flashes every 15 min | The task is running Interactive. Re-run `Install-DashboardTask.ps1` without `-Interactive` to go back to hidden S4U. |
| "Could not load the lab snapshot" on the site | `data.json` is missing from the deploy, or you are opening `index.html` over `file://`. |
| Hours look wrong | The snapshot is only as right as `C:\BrophyUAV\data\schedule.json`. Check there first, and read `SCHEDULE.md`. |
| Wrong day marked "today" | The snapshot's day 0 is whatever day the kiosk was on when it last published. If the kiosk has been off for a week, the whole window list is stale — run the publish by hand. |

## Files

| | |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | the entire site |
| `data.json` | the generated snapshot. **Do not hand-edit** — the next publish overwrites it |
| `netlify.toml` | publish dir and cache headers. No build command, on purpose |
| `robots.txt` | crawlable; the page is meant to be found |
| `publish.log` | what the exporter did. Git-ignored |
| `.snapshot-hash` | local change-detection marker. Git-ignored |
| `C:\BrophyUAV\Publish-Dashboard.ps1` | the exporter |
| `C:\BrophyUAV\Install-DashboardTask.ps1` | registers/removes the scheduled task |
