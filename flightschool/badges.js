/* Flight School badge catalogue — the ONE list the website uses.
   Loaded by flightschool/ (the curriculum), admin/ (approvals and photo
   review) and the course shim. Mirrors the `badges` catalogue in the kiosk's
   config.json (GROUNDSCHOOL-V2-SCOPE.md §3); ids are permanent, kebab-case.

   Tier numbering is the club's: simulator = Tier 0, Meteor = Tier 1.
   2026-10-06: 28 -> 23 badges (Examiner, Shot Planning, Video Systems,
   Airspace, Emergency Procedures folded in; Field Repair = Field Diagnostics).
   2026-10-07: Simulator Flight folded into Proficient Flight (5 sim hours,
   minHours, before a mentor may judge it); Airspace into Event Ops;
   electives became BONUS badges (tier 'el', never counted); est added.
   2026-10-08: 20 counted badges. Each tier's badges END IN A CHECKPOINT
   (checkpoint:true) - the "exam" that moves a pilot up a tier:
     Tiny Whoop (first real Meteor flight)  closes Tier 0 -> Tier 1
     Pavo 20 Pro Flight (new)               closes Tier 1 -> Tier 2
     Event Pilot (new: fly at an event)     closes Tier 2 -> Tier 3
   A checkpoint counts only once every other badge of its tier is earned; it
   shows a check when ready to attempt and turns green when awarded.
   2026-10-07 (display): the site and posters show a tier's other badges as
   the PREREQUISITES of the checkpoint they lead to ("building to Tier 1"),
   and the checkpoint on its own, full width, under the next tier's heading,
   with a tick box per prerequisite and a big check once all are done. Spotter
   moved to Tier 0. Proficient Flight is now called "Sim Flight" (id kept).
   Bench steps end in a PHOTO step: the pilot takes a picture on this site and
   a mentor passes or fails it in the console's Review tab.

   2026-10-10: a witnessed badge may also carry lessons + a quiz (Spotter,
   Event Ops): BOTH are needed - pass the quiz, then a mentor signs it off.
   The quiz alone never earns it (kiosk Apply-QuizResult records the score
   only). Every badge has optional resources (RES below): tips and links.
   Mentor needs deep knowledge of the FAA rules - judged by an officer, no quiz.
